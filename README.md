Developed by ZackDaQuack


Run this command to get started!
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZackDaQuack/macsploit-custom-themes/main/duck.sh)
```


Tutorial:

Alright once you ran the terminal command above you are greeted by the start screen. Press enter the you will be prompted to select your mode.

Mode C: This lets you create your own theme<br />
Mode I: If you already created a theme, then you can use this to install it. The file has to be called **macsploit_theme_zackdaquack.js** and needs to be in your **downloads** folder.

In create mode, you will have to input multiple things. Here is everything you need to know:

background image: Main reason to get a custom theme. You can specify a image url or the path to the image on your computer.
(You can use gifs too)

The rest of these **require** you to use hex. Do not use any other color format or it wont work!<br />
text color: color of the text<br />
text selected: color of the text when its selected<br />
text shadow: super hard to see, but its the shadow lol
